## 🔧 Option 2: Without Node.js Testing {#without-nodejs}

If you can't install Node.js right now, you can still test the frontend:

### What Works Without Backend:
- ✅ **UI Navigation** - All tabs and interface elements
- ✅ **Visual Design** - Complete styling and layout
- ✅ **Button Interactions** - Feedback messages and UI responses
- ✅ **Form Elements** - All input fields and controls

### What Requires Backend:
- ❌ **Real Data Loading** - Hospital/pharmacy listings
- ❌ **Location Services** - Finding nearby facilities  
- ❌ **Disease Alerts** - Current health information
- ❌ **Search Functionality** - Searching healthcare facilities

### To Test Without Backend:
1. **Open `index.html`** directly in your browser
2. **Navigate through tabs** - UI will work perfectly
3. **Click buttons** - You'll see "Backend server not running" messages
4. **Check browser console** (F12) for detailed info
